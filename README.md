Hello, I'm a 30-year-old aspiring web developer whose goal is to make beautiful, user-friendly webpages and to bring my unique perspective to any project I
work on. I heard coding and playing music are similar in some respects. I don't quite understand that yet, but I do play guitar and some piano. So, I'll take it!
